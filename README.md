3D and 2D Image Processing and Visualization GUI
This MATLAB project implements an interactive GUI for visualizing, processing, and analyzing 2D and 3D images. It provides functionality for applying filters, enhancing image quality, and performing segmentation on medical or scientific image datasets. The project is designed for educational purposes and can be expanded for more advanced applications.

Features
3D Image Processing
Load 3D Images: Load and display a 3D image volume from predefined datasets.
3D Gaussian Filter: Smooth the 3D image volume using a Gaussian filter.
3D Median Filter: Reduce noise in the 3D image volume using a median filter.
Volumetric Visualization: Visualize the entire 3D volume interactively using the volshow function.
Save Planes: Extract and save axial and coronal planes from the 3D volume as image files.
2D Image Processing
Load Images from Workspace: Import 2D images for processing.
Gaussian Filtering: Apply a Gaussian filter to smooth 2D images.
Median Filtering: Apply a median filter to reduce noise in 2D images.
Histogram Equalization: Enhance the contrast of 2D images using histogram equalization.
Image Segmentation: Segment specific regions in the 2D or 3D image using the fast marching method.
GUI Layout

Enable real-time editing and annotation on 3D models.
Medical Applications:
Extend for specific applications like tumor detection or organ segmentation.
Incorporate datasets from modalities like CT, MRI, or PET scans.
Cross-Platform Deployment:
Convert the project into a standalone application using MATLAB App Designer.
Develop compatibility with Python-based frameworks like PyQt for broader usage.
Data Integration:
Enable loading data from external sources such as DICOM files or other medical imaging formats.
Add support for cloud storage integration for large datasets.
